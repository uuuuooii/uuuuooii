### Hi my name is Eunhye Kim :)

A web frontend developer with over two years of experience, I have worked on improving code quality and creating a positive development environment. I have helped make products better by improving their architecture, making them run faster, and writing cleaner code. I also set up and maintained processes for reviewing code, making sure that we consistently produce high-quality work throughout each project. So I am a goal-oriented web frontend developer who enhances the value of web products and elevates the team's potential.
